            <h2>Carnatic Music : </h2><hr>
            <div class="one">
                <p>Carnatic music, known as Karnāṭaka saṃgīta or Karnāṭaka saṅgītam in the South Indian languages, is a system of music commonly associated with South India,
                     including the modern Indian states of Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Kerala, Tamil Nadu and portions of east and south Telangana and southern Odisha. It is one of two main subgenres of 
                    Indian classical music that evolved from ancient Hindu texts and traditions, particularly the Samaveda.[1] The other subgenre is Hindustani music,
                     which emerged as a distinct form because of Persian or Islamic influences from Northern India. The main emphasis in Carnatic music is on vocal music; most compositions are written to be sung, 
                     and even when played on instruments, they are meant to be performed in gāyaki (singing) style.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="two">
                <p>Although there are stylistic differences, the basic elements of śruti (the relative musical pitch), svara (the musical sound of a single note), rāga (the mode or melodic formulae), 
                    and tala (the rhythmic cycles) form the foundation of improvisation and composition in both Carnatic and Hindustani music. Although improvisation plays an important role, Carnatic music is mainly
                     sung through compositions, especially the kriti (or kirtanam) – a form developed between the 14th and 20th centuries by composers such as Purandara Dasa, and the Trinity of Carnatic music. 
                     Carnatic music is also usually taught and learned through compositions.[2][3] 
                    Telugu language predominates in the evolution of Carnatic music.[2][3] Most Carnatic compositions are in Telugu, and Sanskrit.</p>

            <div class="three">
                <p> Like all art forms in Indian culture, Indian classical music is believed to be a divine art form which originated from the devas and devis (Hindu gods and goddesses),[8][9] and is venerated as symbolic of nāda brāhman.[10]
                     Ancient treatises also describe the connection of the origin of the svaras, or notes, to the sounds of animals and birds and man's effort to simulate these sounds through a keen sense of observation and perception. The Samaveda, 
                     which is believed to have laid the foundation for Indian classical music, consists of hymns from the Rigveda, set to musical tunes which would be sung using three to seven musical notes during Vedic yajnas. <br> based on musical concepts (including svara, raga, and tala)
                     that were described in detail in several ancient works, particularly the Bharata's Natya Shastra and Cilappatikaram by Ilango Adigal.</p>

                <p>From the 18th century, South Indian immigrant communities abroad increased, especially in Southeast Asia and Ceylon. Communities such as the Nattukottai Chettiars participate in the extension 
                    of the Carnatic cultural scene abroad, thanks to their rich patronage activity.[23] Carnatic music artists therefore perform abroad among South Indian communities who request their coming, in order to enliven local community 
                    life. For a long time in Ceylon, Carnatic music was associated with Indian immigrants, and was often derogatorily referred to as "thosai kade music" 
                    ("music from the dosa shop"), in reference to the South Indians-owned restaurants and eateries that typically played this kind of music
                    From the 20th century, Carnatic music gained significant popularity among certain social strata of the Sri Lankan population, who were then heavily influenced by a prominent cultural movement known as the Hindu revival.

                <p>The main emphasis in Carnatic music is on vocal music; most compositions are written to be sung, and even when played on instruments,
                     they are meant to be performed in a singing style (known as gāyaki).[30] Like Hindustani music, Carnatic music rests on two main elements: rāga, the modes or melodic formulae, and tāḷa, the rhythmic cycles.[30]
                    Today, Carnatic music is presented by musicians in concerts or recordings, either vocally or through instruments. <br> <br>
                     Carnatic music itself developed around musical works or compositions of phenomenal composers (see below).
                     where it gradually replaced from the mid-1930s.

                <h4 id="his6"><b>Śruti : </b></h4>
                <p>Śruti commonly refers to musical pitch.[31] It is the approximate equivalent of a tonic (or less precisely a key) in Western music; it is the note from which all the others are derived. 
                    It is also used in the sense of graded pitches in an octave. While there are an infinite number of sounds falling within a scale (or raga) in Carnatic music, the number that can be distinguished by auditory 
                    perception is twenty-two (although over the years, several of them have converged). 
                    In this sense, while sruti is determined by auditory perception, it is also an expression in the listener's mind.[</p>

            <div class="six">
                <h4 id="his6"><b>Svara : </b></h4>
                <p>
                    Svara refers to a type of musical sound that is a single note, which defines a relative (higher or lower) position of a note, rather than a defined frequency.[31] Svaras also refer to the solfege of Carnatic music, which consist of seven notes, "sa-ri-ga-ma-pa-da-ni" (compare with the Hindustani sargam: sa-re-ga-ma-pa-dha-ni or Western do-re-mi-fa-so-la-ti). These names are abbreviations of the longer names shadja, rishabha, gandhara, madhyama, panchama, dhaivata and nishada. Unlike other music systems, every member of the solfege (called a swara) has three variants. The exceptions are the drone notes, shadja and panchama (also known as the tonic and the dominant), which have only one form; and madhyama (the subdominant), which has two forms. A 7th century stone inscription in Kudumiyan Malai[33] in Tamil Nadu shows vowel changes to solfege symbols with ra, ri, ru etc. to denote the higher quarter-tones. In one scale, or raga, there is usually only one variant of each note present. The exceptions exist in "light" ragas, in which, for artistic effect, there may be two, one ascending (in the arohanam) and another descending (in the avarohanam)

                <h4 id="his6"><b>Raga system: </b></h4>
                <p>
                    A raga in Carnatic music prescribes a set of rules for building a melody – very similar to the Western concept of mode.[34] It specifies rules for movements up (aarohanam) and down (avarohanam), the scale of which notes should figure more and which notes should be used more sparingly, which notes may be sung with gamaka (ornamentation), which phrases should be used or avoided, and so on. In effect, it is a series of obligatory musical events which must be observed, either absolutely or with a particular frequency.[35]

In Carnatic music, the sampoorna ragas (those with all seven notes in their scales) are classified into a system called the melakarta, which groups them according to the kinds of notes that they have. There are seventy-two melakarta ragas, thirty six of whose madhyama (subdominant) is shuddha (perfect fourth from the tonic), the remaining thirty-six of whose madhyama (subdominant) is prati (an augmented fourth from the tonic). The ragas are grouped into sets of six, called chakras ("wheels", though actually segments in the conventional representation) grouped according to the supertonic and mediant scale degrees. There is a system known as the katapayadi sankhya to determine the names of melakarta ragas.

Ragas may be divided into two classes: janaka ragas (i.e. melakarta or parent ragas) and janya ragas (descendant ragas of a particular janaka raga). Janya ragas are themselves subclassified into various categories.

                <h4 id="his6"><b>Tala system : </b></h4>
                <p>
                    refers to a fixed time cycle or metre, set for a particular composition, which is built from groupings of beats.[citation needed] Talas have cycles of a defined number of beats and rarely change within a song. They have specific components, which in combinations can give rise to the variety to exist (over 108), allowing different compositions to have different rhythms.[36]
Carnatic music singers usually keep the beat by moving their hands up and down in specified patterns, and using their fingers simultaneously to keep time. Tala is formed with three basic parts (called angas) which are laghu, dhrtam, and anudhrtam, though complex talas may have other parts like plutam, guru, and kaakapaadam. There are seven basic tala groups which can be formed from the laghu, dhrtam, and anudhrtam:
